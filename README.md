# Steganography
This project is a Python-based implementation of image steganography, allowing users to hide text messages inside images securely. The project utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) for image manipulation, and the PyCryptodome library for optional encryption of the hidden text. The hidden text is encoded in the image using a least significant bit (LSB) method, which makes it difficult to detect the presence of hidden data without specialized tools.

 Install Python:
•	Download Python from python.org.
•	Run the installer and check "Add Python to PATH".
•	Install Python.
Install Dependencies:
•	Open Command Prompt.
•	Run: pip install pillow pycryptodome
•	Run: pip install crypto
•	Run: pip install opencv-python(if needed)
Download and Run Project:
•	Save the project script to a .py file.
•	Run the script on IDE: python   .py file.
